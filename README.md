# kaptain: GUI frontend for shell commands

A fork from http://kaptain.sourceforge.net/. Honours go to author Zsolt TÃ©rek.

> Kaptain is a universal graphical front-end for command line programs. It works on linux/UNIX platforms whereever Qt is available. Release 0.73 is using qmake and is compatible with Qt 4.
>
> Someone writes a simple script (so called grammar) which describes the possible arguments for a command line program and Kaptain brings up a friendly dialog to the user to set up the command line.

[Dokumentation of kaptain](http://kaptain.sourceforge.net/docs/kaptain.html)

This little repo: 
 - stores a copy of the source code
 - provides some binary packages for installation
 - provides instructions for compilation
 - provides a Dockerfile for kaptain in a docker image

# Packages
Currently, this repository provides 64-bit packages only.
*** Note: *** It becomes increasingly difficult to provide packages for recent distribution releases. 
For this reason I stopped to provide new packages. x11docker does not use kaptain anymore.
Unless someone (maybe you?) ports `kaptain` to QT5, I fear it will be abandoned.

## Debian
### jessie, stretch, buster
kaptain is available in the repositories for Debian jessie: https://packages.debian.org/jessie/kaptain.
The provided package can be installed on Debian stretch and buster, too. This package provided here is a copy from Debian jessie repository: 
 - [Download package kaptain for Debian jessie/stretch/buster](https://github.com/mviereck/kaptain/raw/master/kaptain_0.73-2_amd64_debian.deb).
### bullseye/testing
kaptain depends on Qt4 that is no longer available in Debian bullseye/testing. Instead, I provide a custom build with some statically linked Qt4 libs generated with [Dockerfile.staticqt4_debian](https://github.com/mviereck/kaptain/blob/master/Dockerfile.staticqt4_debian):
 - [Download package kaptain for Debian bullseye/testing](https://github.com/mviereck/kaptain/raw/master/kaptain_0.73-3-staticqt4_amd64_debian.deb).
## Ubuntu, Mint and other forks of Ubuntu
kaptain is available in repositories of Ubuntu 14.04: http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/kaptain.
The provided packages can be installed on Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04, too. The package provided here is a copy from Ubuntu repository.
Most likely, the Ubuntu package of kaptain will work on other Ubuntu-based distributions like Linux Mint, too.
 - [Download package kaptain for Ubuntu](https://github.com/mviereck/kaptain/raw/master/kaptain_0.73-1_amd64_ubuntu.deb).
 - If you get an error about missing Qt dependencies, try the [statical build for Debian bullseye/testing](https://github.com/mviereck/kaptain/raw/master/kaptain_0.73-4-staticqt4_amd64_debian.deb). 
   Please report back if that causes issues.

# Porting to QT5
Unfortunately, kaptain is no longer maintained. As it is based on QT4 and not ported to QT5, it already disappears from official repositories. 
It is a quite useful tool and I am not aware of another one that is able to provide its features. 
Personally, I am using it as a graphical frontend for [x11docker](https://github.com/mviereck/x11docker) and some [microscopy tools](https://github.com/mviereck/microscopy-tools).

Is anyone out there who would like to port kaptain to QT5? :-)
